# Active Directory Setup and Configuration on Windows Server

## Summary

This project documents the full setup and configuration of an Active Directory (AD) Domain Controller on a Windows Server machine as part of my preparation for the **Active Directory penetration testing module** of the **eCPPT** course. The goal was to understand the structure, roles, and potential misconfigurations in an AD environment from the defenderâ€™s perspective before approaching it offensively.

---

## Environment Setup

* **Platform:** Windows Server (GUI)
* **Objective:** Promote the server to a domain controller and configure a new AD forest
* **Tools used:**

  * Server Manager
  * PowerShell (`net user`, `Get-ADUser`)
  * Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Rename Computer (Pre-Deployment)

* Renamed the server to reflect its role as a Domain Controller
* Restarted the system to apply the name change
* Confirmed hostname change via System Info

### 2. Install Active Directory Domain Services

* Opened **Server Manager** > **Manage** > **Add Roles and Features**
* Selected **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
* Installation completed after a few minutes

### 3. Post-Deployment Configuration

* Promoted the server to a **Domain Controller**
* Created a **new forest** with a custom root domain name
* Configured:

  * Domain Controller capabilities
  * Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password
  * NETBIOS name
* Finalized and installed
* System automatically restarted

### 4. Verification

* Verified:

  * Computer name
  * Full computer name
  * Domain membership
* Group Policy Client initialized on boot

---

## Managing Users, Groups, and Computers

* Opened **Server Manager** > **Tools** > **Active Directory Users and Computers**
* Reviewed AD structure:

  * Builtin, Computers, Domain Controllers, Users
  * Confirmed the domain controller was listed under "Domain Controllers"
* Created a new user with:

  * Full name
  * Logon name
  * Password (within policy requirements)
* Created a new group and added the user to it

### PowerShell Verification

```powershell
net user <username>
Get-ADUser -Identity <username> -Properties *
```

---

## Misconfiguration Exploration

* Disabled **Kerberos preauthentication** on the user account to demonstrate vulnerability to **AS-REP Roasting**
* Highlighted how basic misconfigurations in account settings can expose an environment
* Reviewed **Password Policies**, **Account Lockout Policies**, and **Remote Access settings**

---

## Lessons Learned

* Setting up AD manually gives insight into how environments are built and where misconfigurations happen
* Many security issues stem from default or overly permissive settings
* Understanding the administrative structure of AD will directly support offensive operations during red team assessments

---

## Next Steps

* Begin the **Active Directory Penetration Testing** section of the eCPPT course
* Use this AD lab environment to practice techniques such as:

  * Kerberoasting
  * AS-REP Roasting
  * Pass-the-Hash / Pass-the-Ticket
  * Lateral movement using PowerShell Remoting and WMI
